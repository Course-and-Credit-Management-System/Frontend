# AGENTS.md

## Project Context
This workspace implements a University Management System (UniPortal / UniAdmin CMS).
All planning, code generation, and review should follow the skill files under `Frontend/.github/skills`, prompt standards under `Frontend/.github/prompts`, and role definitions under `Frontend/.github/agents`.

## Source-of-Truth Order
When rules conflict, apply this precedence:
1. `Frontend/.github/skills/business-logic/SKILL.md`
2. `Frontend/.github/skills/data-schemas/SKILL.md`
3. `Frontend/.github/skills/ui-patterns/SKILL.md`
4. Relevant prompt template (`apiGuide.prompt.md`, `scaffold-page.prompt.md`)
5. Relevant role profile (`academic-advisor.agent.md`, `conflict-resolver.agent.md`)

## Business Logic Rules (Mandatory)
1. Enforce authentication gate:
- If `must_reset_password` is `true`, redirect to `/reset-password`.
- Do not allow dashboard access before reset completion.
2. Role routing after auth/reset:
- `student` -> Student Dashboard.
- `admin`/staff -> Admin Dashboard.
3. Enrollment flow must be sequential and strict:
- Course selection.
- Credit limit check (`total + candidate <= 24`).
- Prerequisite validation against `Academic History` with `Completed` status.
- Retake verification (`is_retake: true` for previously failed courses).
- Final confirmation and persistence.
4. Trade-off logic on credit overflow:
- Preserve retakes.
- Drop electives first.
- Defer core only if needed.
5. Student status constraints:
- Respect registration type (Regular/Private) and academic standing (Active/Probation/Suspended).
- Apply probation/failure caps where required.

## Data Schema Rules (Mandatory)
1. Treat `Frontend/.github/skills/data-schemas/SKILL.md` as schema authority.
2. Match collection field names, enums, and value domains exactly.
3. Use correct polymorphism:
- `User.role='student'` requires `student_profile`.
- `User.role='admin'` requires `admin_profile`.
4. Keep auth data separated (`UserAuth`) and preserve `must_reset_password`.
5. Enforce academic enums exactly, including year/semester labels in the prescribed string format.
6. Frontend types and API payloads must align with schema constraints before integration.

## UI/UX Rules (Mandatory)
1. Follow `Frontend/.github/skills/ui-patterns/SKILL.md` design system.
2. Use the defined palette:
- Primary blue `#0d4a8f`, secondary blue `#1e73be`, teal `#077d8a`, yellow `#ffc20e`.
3. Typography:
- Heading: Poppins (500/600/700).
- Body: Roboto (400, 16px baseline).
4. Tailwind-first styling patterns:
- Buttons/cards with `rounded-[6px]` or specified component radii.
- Form focus/hover states must match design tokens.
5. Reuse layout primitives:
- Sidebar + Header for app pages.
- Standard table, card, and notification patterns.
6. Keep responsive behavior desktop-first with tablet/mobile adaptation.

## API & Typing Rules
1. Use centralized API client (`lib/api.ts`) and TypeScript types (`types.ts`).
2. Prefer generic request typing (`request<T>`) and typed method returns.
3. Standardize error handling with status-aware errors.
4. Include loading and error states for data fetches.
5. Keep code ready for scalable patterns (query caching/interceptors/runtime validation) when extending API layer.

## Prompt-Conformant Scaffolding
When generating a new page:
1. Use functional React components and hooks.
2. Integrate existing `Sidebar` and `Header`.
3. Use Tailwind classes aligned with UI pattern skill.
4. Fetch via `api` singleton and typed interfaces.
5. Implement clear loading, error, and success states.

## Agent Roles
Use these behavior modes when task intent matches:

### Academic Advisor Mode
- Focus: student success, degree planning, dashboard guidance.
- Must apply prerequisite checks and enrollment sequence before recommendations.
- Prioritize retakes, then credit constraints, then prerequisites.
- Tailor advice to registration type and academic standing.

### Conflict Resolver Mode
- Trigger: enrollment exceeds 24 credits or conflict optimization request.
- Resolve using strict priorities:
1. Preserve retakes.
2. Remove electives first.
3. Defer core only when necessary.
- Re-validate prerequisites after each adjustment.

## Output Expectations
1. Proposals and implementations must cite which rules above they satisfy.
2. Never bypass prerequisite or credit-limit checks in generated logic.
3. Keep UI output consistent with UniPortal tokens and component conventions.
4. Keep schema/API outputs strongly typed and enum-safe.
